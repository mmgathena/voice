 Behind me are 100 sets of twins, and
they're going to compete for $250,000.
 Everyone go to your cube.
 Out of these 100 pairs of identical twins,
 only one is walking away with
this quarter of a million dollars.
 And if either twin crosses the
red line, they’ll both be eliminated.
 Let's find out which of you is the best
set of twins and wins the 250 grand.
 I have never been around
this many sets of twins before.
 Everyone looks
so similar, it's crazy
 In school. Did you
ever go to class for him?
 I took a test for him.
 Really? I'm putting that in.
 Right there, the pot of money.
I could get used to that view.
 We got this.
 We got this.
 But little do they know,
 this video is going to put
their bond as twins to the test.
 Shut up.
 Let's go.
 I feel sick to my stomach.
 I’m so sorry
 I’m not gonna
forgive you for that
 I don’t trust you
 You’ll have to drag
us out by our hair!
 Attention, everybody,
 Every challenge in
this video is designed
 so that you and your twin
must work together to pass.
 In the first challenge, this room
is going to flash a series of colors.
 You and your twin must work together
to memorize the order of the colors
 and enter them on your tablet.
 If you enter them
correctly, you stay in,
 if you enter the colors
incorrectly you're eliminated.
 Oh gosh
 I’m low key scared
 I'm gonna start you off easy. For the
first round, the pattern is six colors.
 Blue, Yellow,
Green, Yellow, Blue, Blue.
 Enter the order you
saw them into your tablet.
 Blue, Yellow, Green.
Yellow. Blue. Blue.
 What's interesting
 is some cubes are actually
sharing information with each other.
 I think we got it.
 Did you get it?
 Lock it in.
 If it's wrong, it's
wrong. I love you.
 Love you too.
 Three pairs of twins entered the sequence
incorrectly. Light their cubes Red.
 And fun fact,
 the three pairs that got eliminated
were all right beside each other.
 Everyone cheer
them on as they leave.
 We salute you.
 This next sequence is 15 colors.
 And if you think this is hard,
we're just getting started.
 This is getting to be too much.
 We kept adding more and more
colors to the pattern every round.
 Yellow, Green
 I’m going to see
if I can remember them.
 Blue, Yellow, Green
 I already forgot it.
 Oh, this is bad. Let's just
see who got eliminated.
 No!
 She placed third in our
ages one through 100 Video,
 and then in this
video, you place 93rd.
 I messed it up.
 My heart is absolutely
racing right now.
 And yeah, 15 colors
might be pretty hard,
 but not even close to the
27 colors we got too later.
 Did it end on green?
 No it ended on yellow
 It ended on yellow. You
completely messed up!
 You're not listening.
 Why would I listen to you?
 Help! Help me, help me!
 Push Submit!
Wait it wasn't right!
 All right, everyone has voted
 and in our final round, 12
pairs of twins were eliminated.
 This is everyone that was eliminated.
We gave each pair of twins $1,000.
 And that concludes challenge
number one, 72 pairs of you now remain.
 I told you I’m right!
 Winners! Winn-ers!
 Mr Beast.
 This is the Olympics, and that's my gold
medal. I need to pay off my student debt
 Calling it Derting
twins, top two.
 Top two.
 And like always, we destroyed
all of the eliminated players cubes.
 Karl, that's how
you do it, right there.
 Are you all ready
for challenge two?
 Bring out the second challenge!
 Pay very close attention, this
is where things get interesting.
 Half of you are going to be
eliminated in this challenge.
 Yes, it's going
to be cutthroat.
 Wow.
 Everyone pull the
curtain off of the blocks.
 Feastables?
 They’re Feastables cubes.
We’re stacking something.
 One of you in your cube is
going to put on a blindfold,
 the other is going
to hold this tray.
 The twin who's wearing the blindfold
has to stack all ten cubes on the tray.
 The twin holding the tray will have to move
the completed tower down on the podium.
 But if you drop even
one of the cubes,
 I don't got it!
 You and your twin
are both eliminated.
 Do you want to hold it or stack?
 I'll hold it.
 I'll stack
 You stack.
 Half of us are going home.
 And last thing I
need to mention,
 you'll be competing
against your neighbor,
 and only one set of
twins will be moving on.
 No!
 No!
 It’s either one of us,
 Bruh
 I’m sick!
 We'll start with this section of
cubes. Three. Two. One. Begin.
 Reach out, reach out, reach
out go to the left. Go to the left.
 Get to stacking!
 Down, there you go.
 Because the twin who's blindfolded
will be doing all of the stacking,
 this game completely relies
on your communication as twins.
 Your opponents already
have four stacked.
 Oh God
 Gentle, bring it down slowly.
 Perfect. It's perfect.
 Oh, no. You guys need to hurry.
 Bro, hey, your opponent's
about to stack their final two cubes
 - Where?
- Higher, way high. No no no.
 Luke I need you to hold.
 I can't really help you.
 But completing the tower of
ten cubes is only the beginning.
 The hardest part is moving
the finished tower to the podium.
 Dude. They’re wobbling a lot
 This is the most important
moment of his life.
 Oh no! Oh, they
dropped it. You guys won.
 Yeah!
 And remember if the tower somehow falls
and touches the twin holding the cubes,
 that also counts as a fall
and both of you are eliminated.
 Oh, no.
 Oh!
 Oh great!
 But with some of the other
twins, we saw a different strategy.
 Some chose to not even touch
their cubes or attempt their tower,
 and bet it all on their
opponents tower falling.
 They're going to drop
it. They’re gonna drop it.
 How many blocks are they
at? Have they even got one.
 No.
 Are they just
going to sit there?
 Yeah, they're going to sit there. 
They're corner camping.
 But just waiting for their opponent
to fail wasn't the only tactic we saw.
 You got it!
 This is an interesting strategy
 Go girl go!
 Haha okay. They're trying to distract their
opponents and make their tower fall over.
 You’re going down!
 Well you're going to lose.
Your voice is going down!
 But they're being so loud
 that the twins all the way across
the room can even hear them.
 What's the strategy? I don't know
even know, is yelling a strategy?
 I don't know what you have to do
to stay in, but do not lose to them.
 What is happening?
 All right, ten minutes
left for this round,
 whichever team has the
most blocks when it hits zero.
 Whoever gets the
most blocks, come on.
 When the Collins twins realized
they were running out of time,
 they quickly began stacking
 and they were able to tie it
up at five cubes in each tower.
 How many are they at?
 They at Five.
 Jay, it’s shaking a lot. I think
we buzzer beat this thing.
 Less than 20 seconds
left for this round.
 Wait, I can grab another block.
Do we need another block?
 Go straight.
 Are you going to go for the win?
 Yeah, we are
 Hurry hurry!
Straight... to the left.
 Ten, [Continues on in
background - Nine, Eight]
 All right, come, come
here. Drop it six inches.
 Seven, Six, Five, Four
 Here up, stop, be still!
 Two, One
 Drop!
 It touched his nose. 
He accidentally touched it.
 - Oh my God! You guys won!
- Yes! Yes!
 No!
 No way.
 You’re gonna have to
drag us out by our hair!
 But these games were only getting
more intense as the challenge went on.
 Oh no!
 adjust the...
 Oh, it fell!
 Oh, no.
 During this challenge, we got to see which
team had the strongest twin telepathy.
 Right, come that,
yeah right there
 Bro just directed him with his
head as if he could see him.
 - It's a twin thing.
- It’s a twin thing.
 But the way some of these
other pairs were communicating,
 you could hardly
believe that they're twins.
 Dude keep it still. Keep
it still. Lift it up. You're...
 Oh, he almost hit your head.
 Bro for twins, we are
not coordinated, bro.
 And in our final round, we had two games
that went down to the very last second.
 Two, one. Hands
off! Oh, no! Tower fell
 You won!
 Their stack fell over,
you guys won!
 Yeah!
 They are now one step closer
to a quarter of a million dollars.
 And as promised, half of you
were eliminated in that challenge.
 We're wheeling
in some bunk beds.
 Get some sleep because the
challenges tomorrow will be way harder.
 That last challenge
was like, so difficult
 The Morrises, we've kind of worked together
and have had a really strong alliance.
 So right now it's the two of us
left and we're all in it together,
 What do you think
how does it feel?
 kinda feels like heaven
 Alright goodnight
 Final 36 baby!
 - Goodnight! 
- Sleep well!
 And after the
bloodbath of the first day,
 the twins were a lot more
optimistic than I thought they’d be
 We’re going to win this
challenge. 100,000%.
 We're ready. We're locked in.
 Good morning everybody!
 Guards! Bring out the next challenge.
 Remove the black cloth on the
podium we put outside your cube.
 This next game is
going to test your greed.
 As you can see, each of
you has $5,000 in front of you.
 It's completely up to you
whether or not you take the money.
 And if you do take it,
 there is a 50-50 chance you'll be
randomly selected to be eliminated.
 But if you don't take it, you
are guaranteed to move on.
 We're going to throw
up a ten minute timer.
 Play it safe and move on,
or gamble 250 grand for five.
 The choice is completely yours.
 Why don't we just
take the money?
 Five grand isn't enough
for us to toss our chances.
 Whatcha doing?
 Well, this is guaranteed.
 This is guaranteed, but
you might get eliminated.
 It's not much.
 It's a free five grand.
 I know, but we decided we
want to trust the twin-tuition
 We came here to win big bucks.
 The stress from this decision was
creating tension between some of the twins.
 I say we leave the money.
 You get too uptight.
 No no no don’t, I'm
trying to talk to you.
 I want to walk away with
something like I need the money
 No, that is what our
eyes are on, not that.
 You guys officially
have $5,000. Congrats.
 You don't care
about this five grand?
 No.
 We just want to win the
MrBeast challenge because
 We want bragging rights!
Remember this face, baby!
 Bad Beast Barbies!
 And in the final moments, the last few
twins scrambled to make their decision.
 Take the money bro!
 All right.
 Put that on my shoulder boy!
 I always like to ask myself,
what would Jimmy do?
 I think that Jimmy would take
the money...
 and say, nahhhhh!
 Because eight contestants
have taken the money,
 that means we will be randomly
eliminating four of them right now.
 And to ensure its random, we're
picking their names out of this machine.
 Grab a random name, and
the first elimination is Allen.
 We got bread though!
 Can you carry me out?
 Sure.
 Allen twins come up to the
stage, you can pull the next name.
 The next elimination is Moore.
 No!
 Our greed got the best of us
 And once again, the eliminated
twins will be pulling the next name.
 And the next set of twins
to go are the Miller Twins.
 If we didn't take it, we'd
still be in the cube for 250.
 That's life changing money
for us, so I 100% regret it.
 And the final set
of twins eliminated.
 The DeAngelo twins
are our final elimination.
 We got a guaranteed five K? I felt
like it was the best choice to make.
 You just got to take
what you can get.
 Bye guys, good luck!
 And with that
challenge four is over.
 I'm glad I didn’t take it!
 So far in this video, it's been you
and your twins deciding your fate.
 But for this next challenge,
 you all as a group will decide
if people go or people stay.
 Two buttons are going
to pop up on your tablet.
 If you press the green button,
you're voting to end the challenge.
 And if all of you press
green, this challenge is over.
 If you press the red button,
you can vote someone out.
 Whoever gets the most
votes will be eliminated
 or nobody has to go home if you
all work together and vote green,
 you have five minutes to make a decision.
 Personally, I find it very
rude to vote people out.
 Being a twin is all
about teamwork.
 Green! Vote green!
 Like I said, if they all voted
green, they would all move on.
 But since the Collins twins have
made such a name for themselves.
 You’re going down!
 It didn't seem like that
was going to happen.
 Hey, boys. I think we know
what to do. Stacey and Tracy
 Taking justice
into our own hands.
 Word spread quickly and
after just a few twins voted red,
 it started a chain reaction which made
it clear that someone was going home.
 Stacey and Tracy
 Stacey and Tracy.
 Tracy, Stacey.
 Who’s the biggest threat here? 
Who has personality?
 Who works hard? 
Who’s won every challenge?
 Time is up. You guys
think everyone hit green?
 No.
 Literally no one thinks that. Okay.
 Only two pairs of twins received votes.
And the Haley twins received one vote.
 Bye boo
 And the Collins twins...
 received 26 votes.
 Oh, my God.
 That’s a lot of
votes for Collins
 They’re scared!
 Wait we didn’t vote for us.
 They’re scared!
 The witch is dead.
 Alright thank y'all.
We had a good time.
 I've never seen this many
people work together on anything.
 It's a lot quieter
without them now.
 And now that the common
enemy had been obliterated.
 One and done.
 One and done.
 Everyone decided to vote green.
 Timer has hit zero.
Everybody hit the green button.
 Yeah!
 I’m gonna to go set
up the next challenge.
 That was wild.
 We all could of
turned on each other.
 I'd rather people go out
 on their own terms.
 Yeah, instead of people
just choosing who goes out.
 31 sets of twins remain, but we're about
to give you your hardest challenge yet.
 By the end of it, we will be
in the top ten sets of twins.
 Oh, God.
 Randomly over the next few hours,
 the lights in this room
will turn red like this.
 And when that happens, the first pair
of twins to tap the button on their tablet,
 is safe and moves on.
 But anyone else who
attempted to press the button
 and wasn’t first
will be eliminated.
 We're doing this ten times,
and it's up to you to decide
 which round you press the button.
 Ideally, all 30 of you don't try
to press the button the first time
 Because the more people who attempt
each round, the worse your chances are.
 We’re going to go second, and we
made that point clear to everyone in here.
 What are you
guys doing, first?
 We’re going on one baby!
 I think most people
are gonna go off the bat.
 I have a pretty
good reaction time.
 What's the strategy here?
 We're going for
alarm number two.
 We're gonna like announce it to everyone.
 If you don't want to get
eliminated, don't go two.
 But not everyone was
confident with going early.
 I will say you're very far away
from pressing a button right now.
 Going first is never the answer.
 Okay.
 All right everybody, the
challenge has officially started.
 Good luck
 The moment it
turns red just...
 Dude, I'm telling you right
now, I got this in the bag
 As soon as that
light dims, boom
 - Should I yell Red?
- Oh my gosh
 It could literally
happen any second now.
 Oh, God, I'm so
scared. I'm so scared.
 Oh my gosh.
 That was the first one.
 Yeah baby!
 Oh my God.
 It looks like four pairs of
you attempted round one.
 Let's see who tapped the button first, and
which three pairs of you are going home.
 I don’t usually hold hands like
 I know we don't
usually hold hands.
 So you guys, either
just got eliminated
 - Or we won.
- Or are moving on the top ten?
 Yes
 You pressed it?
 Yeah man!
 A bunch of other people pressed it, we
got to see who actually pressed it first.
 We made it through four challenges.
 Whatever happens, we
should be proud of ourselves.
 Reveal the results
 Oh my God.
 But before the twins
had even a minute to relax
 We got this in the bag
 We decided to surprise
them with another round.
 The alarm went off
 Did it?
 Yes, its red.
 And once again, only four
pairs of you attempted round two.
 You did it?
 Yeah, I did it so fast.
 Reveal the result and by
less than a 10th of a second
 The Cliffords won round two.
 Let’s get it!
 No!
 Dang!
 I'm so proud of y'all.
 Now we're watching
y'all. Y'all gotta make it too!
 Wish us luck!
 If you did not win,
you can step out.
 Bye!
 See ya guys.
 Two sets of twins have
secured their spots in the top ten.
 How many of you are
going to go for the next one?
 You think we go here?
 Yeah.
 Maybe you just wait.
 Stop looking away.
 Maybe on the 10th press,
there's only one of you.
 Focus!
 His finger are far
from the screen.
 You keep looking away. I
can tell you're daydreaming.
 Alright!
 I don’t know if I got that.
 I did it quick, I don’t
know if it was fast enough.
 For round three, three pairs
of you pressed the button.
 Before we reveal the result, we're bringing
all of you the world's best chocolate.
 We need to cheer you guys
up, you seem way to nervous.
 - Feastables! 
- I’d love some chocolate!
 - We love Feastables!
- You want some chocolate?
 Oh, duh!
 The boys are currently handing
everyone Feastable chocolate bars
 AKA the best chocolate on the planet.
 Feastables baby!
 And I’m excited to announce
 we just launched our brand new
cookies and creme Feastables bar.
 Cookies and creme?
 It’s my favorite.
 Cookies and creme!
 Cookies and creme, please!
 You want another one?
 Yeah!
 You want another one?
 Yeah!
 You want another?
 I'm probably biased,
 but this is literally the best
chocolate I've ever had in my life.
 Feastables Cookies and creme
is out now, but we didn't stop there.
 We also launched our brand
new Halloween Multi-pack
 because this year
on Halloween night
 Feastables is going to give
someone a million dollars.
 If you don't hand out
Feastables at Halloween this year,
 clearly you hate
your neighborhood.
 And now for the results of round three,
 which to be honest, is pretty ironic,
the Hershey Twins are the winner.
 Oh my.
 I’m not going to
forgive you for that.
 Sixteen more of you to go
 and there's only seven slots.
 Technically, your odds have improved by
waiting,
 but there's still
a lot of you left.
 Can you tell people
we're going for four?
 You got this.
 You wanna just do it?
 So scared. I don’t
wanna know if it turns red.
 I felt really good about that.
 Round four's winner
is the Beatty twins.
 Let’s go!
 I thought we had it.
 Sorry it didn’t work out.
 No distractions.
 You got this dude.
 Round five is Leiva. You guys
want to step out together? Brutal.
 The Narvaez twins!
 The Morris twins!
 Seven sets of twins remain,
but only three spots are left.
 I’m getting down
right now. Okay?
 Lock in. It’s gonna
happen any second.
 Is Fischer doing it?
 Don't talk.
 Yes.
 It’s just us and Fischer. Just
breathe. Another team is doing it.
 Who?
 It’s the ones up there. 
Get off, get off.
 Badgett’s have their
hand off right now.
 Who? The boys?
 Yeah.
 You have two other competitors.
 Should I go ahead for it?
 Yeah, get ready.
 Alright, they’re
back so lock in.
 Are the ones at
the top locked in?
 Stop asking
 No! No!
 I did, I did it already.
 I was quick.
 You did it fast.
 And the winner of round eight is
 the Badgett twins.
 and after that, round nine's
winner was the Derting twins.
 And round ten was
the Rosenbergs.
 And that concludes this challenge.
 Congratulations to
making it to the top ten.
 Yeah!
 Still top 10 baby.
 Top 10 baby, lets go!
 Make sure you sleep well
tonight, because tomorrow
 one pair of you is winning
that quarter of $1 million.
 I'll see you then.
 We did it together.
 That’s what we’re taking home.
 We’re locked in.
We’re ready to go.
 Tomorrow, I don’t
know what to expect.
 We’re so psyched.
 Hey goodnight.
 Goodnight.
 Goodnight.
 Goodnight top ten.
 Sleep well.
 Good morning everybody.
 For this next challenge,
 we will be dwindling you down
to the final five pairs of twins.
 Each pair of twins will be
facing another pair of twins
 in a comically large game of
bowling, each with a 105 pins.
 We got this challenge
in the bag, baby.
 And to make it even
more interesting,
 the twin that is the
bowler will be blindfolded.
 That changes things
 And the other one will have
to guide you where to bowl.
 I'm not worried about it.
 We're going to beat whoever.
 Since you won the first
round of the button game.
 Simone Biles
 We’re going to let you pick who you
go up against. Have fun strategizing.
 We don’t go bowling a
lot but I think I should bowl.
 You guys good bowlers?
 Not really.
 I suck.
 Rosenbergs,
they’re like a bit older.
 They got glasses. They’re
probably great bowlers.
 We just got to give it our all.
 And while they’re strategizing, I want
to tell you about our brand new product,
 Lunchly,
 which pairs Feastables and Prime together
in a better for you version of Lunchables.
 Lunchly comes in
three flavors.
 Fiesta Nachos, Turkey
Stack ‘ems, and The Pizza.
 And inside each box is a miniature
Prime and a miniature Feastables.
 Let’s go see what the twins
think of them. How’s it going?
 Oh.
 We got pizza, turkey, nachos.
Whichever one you want.
 - I’ll get the pizza. 
- The nachos look so good.
 And that is real cheese.
 Oh, these are fire.
 Yummy. Delicious.
Better than Lunchables.
 - You guys hungry?
- Oh, yeah.
 Each meal comes with a tiny Feastables
bar. Their last name is Hershey’s.
 That might be some of the
best chocolate I’ve ever had
 and that’s saying something
because we’re Hershey’s.
 And Lunchly is only around $5.
 I can't wait to see what you guys
think and up first, the Sansone twins.
 Am I the bowler or
are you the bowler?
 I don’t care, I’ll do it.
 You can step out.
 Promise?
 Yes, I promise you will not be
eliminated. Follow me over here.
 How does it feel to
be outside the cube?
 This is so weird.
 So this is your bowling lane and now you
must pick one other cube to go up against.
 Bro, this is crazy.
 Who you face is up to you.
 Pick us. Just pick us.
 You won’t.
 I’m not picking you.
 - Sorry. No.
- No.
 You gotta remember,
it’s blindfolded bowling.
 So it’s not all about strength.
It’s also about strategy.
 Okay, we’re going to
pick the Hershey twins.
 Let’s go.
 Whichever pair of twins knocks down the
most pins with three bowls, will move on.
 The other pair will be eliminated.
 Okay, ready? 
Go this way.
 Three. Two. One. Go!
 Good, good, good,
good. Good job.
 Wow. Oh my gosh.
 That’s really bad.
 Okay. What do you want me to do?
 Not that much force
for both of them.
 Netiher one of us put
enough on that first one.
 Blindfold up.
Let’s do round two.
 Yes. Just like that.
You got it.
 - Two. One. Go.
- Straight. You got it.
 I don’t even know. I am
stressing out right now.
 The Hershey’s twins knocked out 48 pins
and the Sansone twins knocked down 37.
 They are 11 behind with one bowl remaining.
 Get mad. Are you mad?
 Yes.
 Act like it.
 $250,000 on the line.
 Let’s see if they clutch up.
 Three. Two. One. Go!
 - Great job. 
- Oh my God.
 Great job.
 I actually have no
idea who won now.
 Oh my god.
 The Hershey's
messed up big time.
 That might have been the
comeback of the century.
 That hurt.
 The Hershey twins
knocked down 55 pins.
 The Sansone twins knocked
down 79 and are moving on.
 Yeah!
 Oh my gosh.
 Who do you want to go next?
 Pick us, pick us.
 We’re going to pick
the Beatty twins.
 Alright, you two can
head back to your cubes.
 Thank you.
 Who do you think you
want to go against?
 I think those two kids up there.
 Alright, we’ll pick them.
 Narvaez twins, I’m
coming to get you.
 Godspeed.
 Godspeed.
 Twins, are you ready?
 Yes.
 Yep.
 Three. Two. One. Go!
 Let's go.
 I will take it.
 Alright, blindfold up.
 Go.
 They’re off.
 Oh, that might have
been a comeback.
 Y'all chose us. Y'all chose us.
 Man, that’s a lot
of pins down dude.
 $250,000 on the line.
 Get your twins in position.
 Three. Two, one. Go!
 The last bowls.
 Oh my gosh.
 No!
 89 pins knocked down,
 to 74, sorry gentleman.
 GG’s boys.
 Who do you want to go next?
 These guys.
 Knowing that only five pairs
of twins were moving on,
 they all chose their
opponents carefully.
 I think we’re going to
go with the Badgett’s.
 Oh my gosh.
 The blindfolds are on. Go!
 Right down the middle.
 Oh.
 I’m so sorry.
 Alright, who’s next?
 - Leiva’s.
- Leiva’s.
 All right.
 The Clifford's.
 You can exit your cube.
 Three. Two. One. Go!
 It was becoming clear who is
the biggest threat in this challenge.
 I used to be in a league.
 I’m friends with a lot of
people who are in a league.
 Bowling is a strength.
 Do you guys think
you're a fierce competitor?
 I'm not too worried.
 And the final two sets
of twins, come on down.
 Let’s see which
one will move on.
 Alright gentlemen,
put your blindfolds on.
 $250,000 on the line.
 I’m so glad we didn’t have
to go against either of them.
 Three. Two. One. Go!
 Oh, my gosh.
 Dude, those are
both very good.
 Great bowl.
 Okay, okay.
 Those are our best ones yet.
 You can definitely tell
they both have experience.
 It is neck and neck.
 This had to be the match up.
 Oh, yeah.
 Let's see if that changes.
 Three two. One Go!
 Oh, the ricochet.
 Woah, I don’t know.
 Dude, they barely
have any pins left.
 The last bowl of the challenge,
 one of these twins
are about to go home
 and one’s going to top five.
 Three. Two. One. Go!
 Oh my gosh.
 They might have made a comeback.
 That was a good ball though. That’s
the best play you could have had there.
 I think that’s good enough.
 Oh my gosh.
 Wow. This is going
to be a close game.
 And the final tally is 82
pins knocked down...
 to 86.
 Yes! Yes! Yes!
 Oh my goodness.
 Congrats on making it to the
final five. We have the Beatty twins.
 Gotta do what
you gotta do, right?
 Top five baby.
 The Clifford twins.
 Let's go!
 The Derting twins.
 We're freaking out.
 The Sansone twins.
 And the Morris twins.
 The bowling champ right here.
 Now we’ll be going head to
head in one final challenge
 for this quarter of $1 million.
 Good luck to everybody.
 You ready for the
final challenge?
 - Yeah.
- Yeah.
 A little bit of nerves, but I mean
we’re happy we made it this far.
 Oh, we’re stoked.
 So if you won, what are you
going to spend the money on?
 We're going to go to Japan.
 Japan and school.
 We talked about investing.
 Buy my parents a new house.
 Really?
 Probably not.
 Going to put it like all in our brand
and you’re going to make us rich,
 famous rockstars.
 - Oh, really?
- Yeah.
 My parents. I mean, they
have three kids in college,
 and they’re trying
to help us through so
 it would mean the world
if we could help them out
 and then I’ll probably
buy a new fishing rod.
 - Good luck in this next challenge. 
- Thank you.
 Thank you.
 I appreciate it.
 - Thank you!
- Thank you!
 I appreciate it, Jimmy.
 At the start of this challenge,
we had a hundred cubes
 and now we’re down to five.
 Congrats on making it this far.
 But up to this point we’ve still not
determined who the best set of twins is.
 So for the grand finale, you may
exit your cubes and come down here.
 The final challenge will
be right here in the middle.
 This is terrifying.
 I’m excited for any
of you guys to win this.
 Bring out the podiums.
 - Oh my God.
- What?
 This is so scary.
 If you’ve seen our
50 YouTubers video,
 this probably
looks a little familiar.
 At the beginning of each round,
everyone will start off blindfolded.
 Meanwhile, I will be
shuffling these five briefcases.
 Now the left side of you
may take off your blindfold.
 Which briefcase do you want?
 Can I just pick it up?
 Yeah, just pick it up.
 Put it on your podium.
 Four of these
briefcases are empty,
 while one of them holds the check for
the grand prize of a quarter of $1 million.
 All five of them have now
looked inside their briefcase,
 and only they
know what's in there.
 The players without briefcases,
 will cast a vote to eliminate
one set of twins from the game.
 The contestants with the most votes
must reveal what’s inside the briefcase
 and if their case is
empty, they’re eliminated.
 But if their case has a
check for $250,000 inside.
 You’ll never believe this, but that pair of
twins wins the grand prize of $250,000.
 If twin telepathy was a thing,
now would be the time to use it.
 Throw up a ten minute timer.
Everyone decide who you're voting for.
 Hey Morris at the
end. Do you have it?
 I might.
 He’s shaking a little.
 I don't think he has it.
 Do you think you have a good understanding
of what your brother's thinking?
 I think so.
 Does anyone want to admit they have the
$250,000?
 Oh, so you’re
saying you have it.
 I have it.
 That’s bold. That’s some
Beatty stuff right there.
 I don’t know, why would he would
just say he has the money, though?
 Yeah. That’s so sus.
 Who are you voting for?
Are you voting for your brother?
 I don't know.
 Toss me the vote.
Toss me the vote.
 How well can you read your
counterpart? You guys grew up together.
 Vote for me.
 Dude, stop. Just stop talking
because you’re freaking me out.
 45 seconds.
 I think we should vote him out
because I don’t think they have it.
 I don’t think he has it
either. I’m going to be honest.
 What if they do have it?
 You’re going to have
to start writing soon.
 I’m just writing who
I’m confident for.
 Five, four, three, two, one.
 Alright, Karl, gather their votes.
 Feel good about this?
 I don't know.
 The first vote was for Clifford.
 The second vote was Morris.
 The third vote was Sansone.
 Oh, we have one vote for
three separate pairs of twins.
 The fourth vote was for Beatty.
 The fifth and final
vote...
 is Beatty,
 which means they received two
and will be opening their briefcase.
 Oh my God.
 No way dude.
 I have it, yeah.
 No!
 It's empty! Wait,
did you vote for him?
 I voted for him.
 You voted for your own brother.
 The Beatty twin with the briefcase
almost executed the perfect bluff.
 That is until his own brother
couldn’t even read his poker face.
 Could’ve just kept
your mouth shut.
 Don't worry though boys,
you're not leaving empty handed.
 - Appreciate you man. 
- Hey, good luck!
 Bye guys.
 With that, I need all of
you to put on the blindfolds
 and we’re going to
reshuffle the briefcases.
 Now, the opposite side will be
picking briefcases this go-around.
 Joe watch people’s body
language as they open it.
 Yeah.
 Would you like briefcase
number one, two, three or four?
 Three.
 Alright, third briefcase.
 Oh.
 Give me two.
 I'll put it on your podium.
How about you? one or two?
 One.
 Here you go. Morris, that
leaves you with the final briefcase.
 Now, only the people with the
briefcase may remove their blindfolds.
 Look at what’s
inside your briefcase.
 Only they know what’s in there.
 Alright, I need all of
you to close it now.
 You may take
off your blindfolds.
 Start the ten minute timer.
Let’s see how this goes.
 Do you have it?
 I might have it.
 Do you have it?
 I don't have the money now.
 What about y’all down there?
 Don’t have it.
 So nobody here has it.
 That's just factually not true.
 Somebody has it.
 I don’t think the
Sansone’s have it.
 I agree with you.
 I feel like you’re all
being sus, so I can’t really-
 Well duh.
 I think the Morrises have it and I already
placed my vote on who I want to get rid of.
 I think Clifford’s
have the money.
 If you’re making a decision now,
that means you have the money.
 That's what you think, bro.
 I’m voting for Morris.
 I think Morris has the money.
 I’m telling you, they
got the money, bro.
 I'm sorry. I love you all.
 Three. Two. One. Time is up.
 Oh my God.
 Oh my gosh.
 The first vote is for Morris.
 The second vote
 is also for Morris.
 I'm so nervous.
 Did you listen to me? 
Did you listen to me?
 The third vote is for Derting.
 If Derting and gets
another vote, it’s a tie.
 If not, the Morris twins will
be opening their briefcase.
 The final vote
 is Derting.
 We have a tie.
 You guys have three
minutes to decide.
 The four of you recast votes either
for Derting or Morris to break the tie.
 Wait. So who should I vote for?
 He looks so stressed.
 Is he fake stressing?
 The Morrises have the money. Vote Derting
if you want to continue is what I’m saying.
 Don't put my name down.
 You see, like they’re trying
to, like, save theirself now,
 that’s what I’m saying
just listen to the boy like..
 Crystal, what do you think?
 I don’t know.
 Ten seconds.
 If you want to make the top
three, you just put their name down.
 Trust me. Trust me,
trust me. Trust me.
 -Four.
- Or maybe they’re lying.
 Three.
 Trust me, bro, trust me.
 One. Hands down.
 I hate to do it bro.
 Let’s tally these votes.
 Morris or Derting one of
you is opening your briefcase.
 Our first vote
 is for Derting.
 Our second vote
 is also for Derting.
 The third vote
 is for Derting.
 The fourth vote, which is
now irrelevant, is also Derting.
 Four?
 All four of them voted
for the Derting twins.
 Bro.
 Reveal what is
in your briefcase.
 Fourth place,
baby. Fourth place.
 Told you.
 Oh my God.
 You’re also going
home with $10,000.
 - That’s awesome!
- There you go.
 And now that all of you at
home know how this game works,
 for this next round, we’re not even
gonna reveal who has the money.
 You want one, two or three?
 I’ll do two.
 I’ll do one.
 Karl give Morris the last one.
 The three of you with
briefcases, take your blindfolds off.
 Look inside your briefcase.
 Alright, close them.
 You guys may take off your
blindfolds.
 Start the timer.
 I think I have an
idea of who has it.
 And who’s that?
 Wait, you think they have it?
 Again.
 What if you had it, though?
 She looks nervous. That’s all.
 I mean I’ve been nervous.
 I’m telling you,
they got that.
 So then what? Do you
want to be voted out?
 Hey, you saying they have the money means
their only option is to vote for you.
 Do you have the money?
 Do you want to come look?
 John.
 YOU DON'T HAVE IT?
 $250,000 on the line.
 You got 47 seconds. One of you is
going to be walking away with the money.
 Okay. Who do you think?
 I feel like Clifford
has the money.
 Clifford, you guys have
been right in the past two.
 You make up your
mind I’ll vote for whoever.
 I’ve got the suitcase, but I can’t
help everyone vote every round, like-
 15 seconds. I'd start writing.
 Give me something.
 I know what I’m doing.
 Okay. She knows
what she's doing.
 Do you have it in your
suitcase? Yes or no?
 I might have it in my suitcase.
 He’s lying.
 How am I lying?
 I don’t know, I don’t
know, I don’t know.
 Five. Four. Three. Two. One.
 Pens down.
 The first vote
 is for Morris.
 The second vote...
 is also Morris.
 We don’t even need to
see what the third one is.
 Bring the table on over.
 Good luck guys.
 All right, Morrises, it all
comes down to this moment.
 You do not know
what’s inside of here.
 Alright, you want to show him?
 If it’s empty. They lose.
 And the game continues
until there’s a winner.
 But if it has
$250,000, it’s theirs.
 Ah, you got it!
 Yes, yes, yes.
 Good job, bro.
 I’m gonna cry.
 It’s okay.
 What are you guys going
to spend the money on?
 It's going to our family. I mean, they
work so hard for us. I couldn't be happier.
 Pull it apart.
 That is your $125,000
and that is his $125,000.
 Dude.
 Congrats.
 And, dude, I can't believe it.
